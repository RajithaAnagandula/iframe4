            <p> Suriya has been a patron of Tamil Nadu Kidney Research Foundation since 2007. 
                In the same year, he also acted in a short film on AIDS awareness.
                He has also lent his voice to other noble causes such as "Save The Tigers" campaign, 
                which aids in the protection and preservation of Tigers in India, and "REACH",
                a non-profit that cures TB patients for free using supervised medication programs. 
                In 2019, Suriya criticised the union government's Draft National Education Policy (NEP), 
                claiming that several of its features would affect students from rural areas.
                He said the policy sought to impose entrance and qualifying examination on students and the three language formula in Tamil Nadu. 
                His statements were criticized by BJP and AIADMK leaders</p>
